## **Output Requirements**

### 1. **Reasoning Summary**
Provide a concise, well-reasoned summary explaining the relationship between the claim and the evidence.

## **Confidence Scoring Framework**

Use this systematic approach to generate consistent confidence scores (0-100):

### Evidence Quality Assessment (40 points maximum)
- **Primary Sources (40pts)**: Official documents, government data, academic studies, direct statements
- **Secondary Sources (30pts)**: Reputable news organizations, established fact-checkers, verified experts
- **Tertiary Sources (20pts)**: General websites, blogs with citations, social media from verified accounts
- **Unverified Sources (10pts)**: Anonymous sources, unverified social media, opinion pieces
- **No Sources (0pts)**: No supporting evidence found

### Source Reliability Scoring (30 points maximum)
- **Highly Reliable (30pts)**: Reuters, AP, BBC, government agencies, peer-reviewed journals, established institutions
- **Generally Reliable (25pts)**: Major newspapers, recognized news outlets, verified expert organizations
- **Moderately Reliable (15pts)**: Smaller news outlets, specialized publications with good track record
- **Questionable Reliability (5pts)**: Sources with known bias, limited verification, mixed track record
- **Unreliable (0pts)**: Known misinformation sources, completely unverified content

### Evidence Consistency (20 points maximum)
- **Full Consensus (20pts)**: All reliable sources agree completely
- **Strong Consensus (15pts)**: Most reliable sources agree, minor discrepancies in details
- **Partial Consensus (10pts)**: Some reliable sources agree, notable contradictions exist
- **No Consensus (5pts)**: Reliable sources significantly contradict each other
- **Conflicting Evidence (0pts)**: Strong evidence exists for contradictory claims

### Verification Completeness (10 points maximum)
- **Comprehensive (10pts)**: Multiple independent sources verify all aspects of the claim
- **Substantial (8pts)**: Key aspects verified by multiple sources, minor gaps
- **Partial (5pts)**: Some aspects verified, significant gaps remain
- **Minimal (2pts)**: Very limited verification available
- **None (0pts)**: No verification possible with available evidence

## **Examples**

### Example 1
**Claim:** "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 for the World's Fair in Paris."

**Evidence:**
1. "The Eiffel Tower was constructed between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair)."
2. "Gustave Eiffel's iconic tower opened to the public on March 31, 1889."
3. "The structure was built to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution."

**Reasoning Summary:**
The evidence strongly supports the claim. Multiple sources confirm the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 specifically for the World's Fair in Paris (Exposition Universelle). Construction dates, opening date, and the event's purpose align with the claim's assertions.

**Keywords from the Claim:**
- Eiffel Tower
- 1889
- World's Fair
- Paris
- completed

**Evidence Summary:**
- Construction period: 1887-1889, serving as entrance arch for the Exposition Universelle
- Official opening date: March 31, 1889
- Built to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution
- Direct confirmation that the event was the 1889 World's Fair in Paris

**Confidence Score: 95/100**
- Evidence Quality: 40/40 (primary historical sources)
- Source Reliability: 30/30 (established historical records)
- Evidence Consistency: 20/20 (full consensus across sources)
- Verification Completeness: 10/10 (all claim aspects verified)
- Total: 100, adjusted to 95 due to historical nature (minor uncertainty typical in historical claims)

### Example 2
**Claim:** "Drinking eight glasses of water daily is a medically established requirement for all adults."

**Evidence:**
1. "The '8 glasses a day' rule has no scientific basis and likely originated from a 1945 recommendation that included water from food."
2. "Hydration needs vary significantly based on body size, activity level, climate, and health conditions."
3. "The National Academies recommends adequate intake levels, not a universal 8-glass rule."

**Reasoning Summary:**
The evidence contradicts the claim. Sources indicate the eight-glasses rule lacks scientific foundation and oversimplifies hydration needs. Medical guidance emphasizes individual variation rather than a universal requirement, showing the claim misrepresents established medical recommendations.

**Keywords from the Claim:**
- eight glasses of water
- daily
- medically established
- requirement
- adults

**Evidence Summary:**
- The 8-glasses rule has no scientific basis according to available evidence
- Origin traced to 1945 recommendation that included water from food sources
- Hydration needs vary by individual factors: body size, activity, climate, health
- National Academies recommends adequate intake levels, not a universal standard
- No medical establishment supports this as a requirement for all adults

**Confidence Score: 85/100**
- Evidence Quality: 35/40 (secondary medical/scientific sources)
- Source Reliability: 25/30 (reputable health organizations)
- Evidence Consistency: 20/20 (full consensus contradicting claim)
- Verification Completeness: 8/10 (key aspects verified, comprehensive refutation)
- Total: 88, rounded to 85 (high confidence in refutation)

### Example 3
**Claim:** "A new species of dolphin was discovered off the coast of Australia in March 2024."

**Evidence:**
1. "Marine biologists have been studying cetacean populations near Australia's Great Barrier Reef."
2. "Several dolphin species are native to Australian waters, including bottlenose and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins."
3. "Conservation efforts focus on protecting existing dolphin habitats from climate change."

**Reasoning Summary:**
The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. While sources discuss dolphin research and species in Australian waters, none specifically mention a new species discovery in March 2024. Additional evidence would be needed to confirm or refute this claim.

**Keywords from the Claim:**
- new species
- dolphin
- discovered
- Australia
- March 2024

**Evidence Summary:**
- Marine biologists are studying cetacean populations near Great Barrier Reef
- Known dolphin species in Australian waters include bottlenose and Indo-Pacific humpback
- Conservation efforts ongoing for existing dolphin habitats
- No specific mention of new species discovery in March 2024
- Evidence addresses dolphin research but not the specific claim

**Confidence Score: 20/100**
- Evidence Quality: 10/40 (general information, not directly relevant)
- Source Reliability: 15/30 (sources reliable but don't address specific claim)
- Evidence Consistency: 0/20 (no sources address the specific claim)
- Verification Completeness: 0/10 (claim remains unverified)
- Total: 25, adjusted to 20 (insufficient evidence for meaningful assessment)
